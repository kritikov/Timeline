# Timeline
Timeline is a JavaScript class that allows the creation and display of events in the browser. The main component is the timelines in which the events 
belonging to each of them are placed. The timelines are placed sequentially, and the events they contain are placed either above the timeline line or below. 
There is also the periods line that is placed at the top of the graph, and in which each period spreads over a number of consecutive timelines showing that 
they belong to the same period.

The Timeline includes two files, one in javascript and one in css. For more informations read the included manual.
